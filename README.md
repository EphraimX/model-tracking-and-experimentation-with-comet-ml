# Model Tracking and Experimentation with DVC

### This repo contains the demo code for the "Model Tracking and Experimentation with DVC" article. 

- Data Version Control is a new type of data versioning, workflow, and experiment management software, that builds upon Git (although it can work stand-alone). DVC reduces the gap between established engineering toolsets and data science needs, allowing users to take advantage of new features while reusing existing skills and intuition. - Iteratice.ai, creator of DVC
